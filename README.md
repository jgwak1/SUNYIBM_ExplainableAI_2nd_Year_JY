TODO @ 2024-2-24: 

Build for SilkService & SilkETW on my Windows Local Machine
with 'msbuild' with sln file in "SilkETW__JY_custom_filter.zip" 
Make it exactly same as the "SilkETW_SilkService_v8" in VM (only except updated filter)

Replace the "SilkETW_SilkService_v8" with the 
newly built one in the VM.
