TODO @ 2024-2-24: 

Build for SilkService & SilkETW on my Windows Local Machine
with 'msbuild' with sln file, based on the custom filter 
(in 'ETWCollector.cs'). 
Make it exactly same as the "SilkETW_SilkService_v8" in VM (only except updated filter)

Replace the "SilkETW_SilkService_v8" with the 
newly built one in the VM.
